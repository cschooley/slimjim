a website you don't have to patch

I wrote this because I was tired of having a personal site that was:

* "Under Construction"
* Running some blog engine that needs constant updaates and MySQL to say "hello world"
* Costing me $5/mo. for what is essentially a landing page for LinkedIn/ghthub

I use provider for my mail services that includes the ability to host static HTML files on your own domain; I am cheap; SlimJim was born.
