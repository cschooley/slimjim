# SlimJim

a website you don't have to patch

## Usage
* Extract checkout the SlimJim repository to a folder on your web page (the root the site it will host)
* Use web-dav, vim remote files, or any other means to edit and manage the .md files
* Make links to documents like this: [one](#test.md)
* Make links to folders like this: [two](#dropdown)
   * In each sub-folder create an index.md as appropriate (see dropdown/index.md as an example)
* Edit index.html as you see fit
   * Swap bootstrap templates, themes
   * Intermix native html with .md
   * Just don't do anything server-side, or what's the point.
